socket.accept() = Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and 
    # listening for connections. The return value is a pair (conn, address) 
    # where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the 
    # connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.

_thread.start_new_thread(function, args[, kwargs]) =
    #start a new thread and return the identifier

socket.accept() = accepts any incoming connection

socket.sendall(bytes[, flags]) = Send data to the socket. The socket must be connected 
    #to a remote socket.

socket.send(bytes[, flags]) = Sends data to the socket

socket.recv(bufsize[, flags]) = Receive data from the socket

socket.listen(ammountOfClients) = looking for clients

socket.bind((server,port)) = combines the two so that it can be sent properly

socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE) for IPv4

socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE) for IPv6.

x.connect((server,port)) = conencts to the server
